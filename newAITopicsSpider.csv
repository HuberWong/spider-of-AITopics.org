Some of the biggest tech names have laid off artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) employees this fall, including Meta, Twitter and Amazon. In light of that, it would make sense for industry nerves to be high entering 2023, but that's not the case. Even in the midst of a possible recession, AI experts across several industries told VentureBeat that they expect AI innovation to continue and companies to adjust budgets and priorities accordingly. In fact, these industry leaders resoundingly underscored three areas where AI has thrived over the past year and will continue to grow in 2023: workplace automation and human-centric AI; data-driven AI decision-making; and generative AI use cases.",2022-12-01T20:30:39Z

Like countless military and sports terms before it, we now understand it in a broader context. It's one of those phrases that perfectly encapsulates a commonly understood experience -- projects whose size, scope and focus shift so gradually you hardly even notice.

The AI developed by the UK-based company DeepMind became one of the top-ranked online players of the Napoleonic-themed board game Stratego by learning to bluff with weaker pieces and sacrifice important pieces for the sake of victory. ""To us the most surprising behaviour was [the AI's] ability to sacrifice valuable pieces to gain information about the opponent's set-up and strategy,"" says Julien Perolat at DeepMind. The game of Stratego involves two players trying to capture the opponent's flag hidden among an array of 40 game pieces. Most pieces consist of soldiers numbered from one to 10, with the higher-ranked soldiers defeating lower-ranked soldiers during encounters on the board. But players cannot see the identities of opponent game pieces unless two pieces from opposing armies encounter one another – unlike games such as chess or Go where both players can see everything.",2022-12-01T19:00:26Z

Using the face re-aging network (FRAN), filmmakers can now make actors look as young as 20 or as old as 80 years old just by inputting the person's headshot into the system that then predicts parts of the face should be altered by age. It then adds effects like wrinkles or smoothed skin as a layer on the actor's face in the film or television show without requiring a skilled artist to alter frame-by-frame manually, which typically causes facial identity loss. Disney touts its AI tool as being the first solution of its kind that can automatically alter an actor's age on video despite expressions, lighting conditions and viewpoints. The system was trained on 2,000 synthetically generated images, allowing it to learn different facial expression in order to keep the altered age layer stable as the actor moves in the film.",2022-12-01T17:50:08Z
