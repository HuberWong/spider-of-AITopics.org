Challenges and opportunities in quantum machine learning - Nature Computational Science,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00311-3,"At the intersection of machine learning and quantum computing, quantum machine learning has the potential of accelerating data analysis, especially for quantum data, with applications for quantum materials, biochemistry and high-energy physics. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding the trainability of quantum machine learning models. Here we review current methods and applications for quantum machine learning. We highlight differences between quantum and classical machine learning, with a focus on quantum neural networks and quantum deep learning. Finally, we discuss opportunities for quantum advantage with quantum machine learning. Quantum machine learning has become an essential tool to process and analyze the increased amount of quantum data. Despite recent progress, there are still many challenges to be addressed and myriad future avenues of research.",2022-10-16T13:40:38Z
DeepMind breaks 50-year math record using AI; new record falls a week later,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/deepmind-breaks-50-year-math-record-using-ai-new-record-falls-a-week-later/,"Matrix multiplication is at the heart of many machine learning breakthroughs, and it just got faster--twice. Last week, DeepMind announced it discovered a more efficient way to perform matrix multiplication, conquering a 50-year-old record. This week, two Austrian researchers at Johannes Kepler University Linz claim they have bested that new record by one step. Matrix multiplication, which involves multiplying two rectangular arrays of numbers, is often found at the heart of speech recognition, image recognition, smartphone image processing, compression, and generating computer graphics. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are particularly good at performing matrix multiplication due to their massively parallel nature.",2022-10-16T13:40:32Z

How Markov Random Fields work part2(Advanced Statistics),https://medium.com/@monocosmo77/how-markov-random-fields-work-part2-advanced-statistics-964d8f32afe5,"Abstract: UNet [27] is widely used in semantic segmentation due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, its manually-designed architecture is applied to a large number of problem settings, either with no architecture optimizations, or with manual tuning, which is time consuming and can be sub-optimal. In this work, firstly, we propose Markov Random Field Neural Architecture Search (MRF-NAS) that extends and improves the recent Adaptive and Optimal Network Width Search (AOWS) method [4] with (i) a more general MRF framework (ii) diverse M-best loopy inference (iii) differentiable parameter learning. This provides the necessary NAS framework to efficiently explore network architectures that induce loopy inference graphs, including loops that arise from skip connections. With UNet as the backbone, we find an architecture, MRF-UNet, that shows several interesting characteristics.",2022-10-16T13:40:15Z

L.A.'s fragile Black-Latino alliance: Can it survive racist recordings in a changing city?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-16/in-la-politics-latino-and-black-alliances-are-strong-and-complicated,"Jorge Nuño learned the hard way how race, power and politics work in Los Angeles. Nuño, 45, the son of immigrants from Jalisco, Mexico, grew up in South Los Angeles near Vernon Avenue and Main Street, then built a successful graphic design business and a printing business, launched a multiracial youth services nonprofit, and threw himself into grass-roots organizing among both Black and Latino groups in his neighborhood. With this background, he decided to run for City Council representing the 9th District -- its constituents majority Latino -- expecting his campaign would garner at least some interest from the city's traditional Latino establishment. Instead, word filtered down: No way. ""What I heard was that no Latino [power brokers] are going to come support any candidate coming out of South L.A.,"" he said, ""because there is a coordination between Black and brown caucuses about keeping it Black"" through the tenure of the current councilman. With Los Angeles still reeling from a leak revealing prominent elected officials making bigoted and racist remarks, much about the recording remains a mystery: Who made it? Nuño lost that election to the incumbent, Curren Price, a Black former state lawmaker who also grew up in South L.A. He said he simply did not understand the complicated alliances brokered by Black and Latino politicians and their allies in labor.

Tiny particles work together to do big things,https://robohub.org/tiny-particles-work-together-to-do-big-things/,"MIT chemical engineers have shown that specialized particles can oscillate together, demonstrating a phenomenon known as emergent behavior. Taking advantage of a phenomenon known as emergent behavior in the microscale, MIT engineers have designed simple microparticles that can collectively generate complex behavior, much the same way that a colony of ants can dig tunnels or collect food. Working together, the microparticles can generate a beating clock that oscillates at a very low frequency. These oscillations can then be harnessed to power tiny robotic devices, the researchers showed. ""In addition to being interesting from a physics point of view, this behavior can also be translated into an on-board oscillatory electrical signal, which can be very powerful in microrobotic autonomy.

Either it fears, is destroyed, and is overwhelmed by technological progress, or it dictates this progress, drives it forward, and uses it. And then there are two major social constructs that keep the members of society in compliance with the prevailing ideology of life. These are religion and the state.",2022-10-16T10:15:44Z

Tiny particles work together to do big things,https://robohub.org/tiny-particles-work-together-to-do-big-things/,"MIT chemical engineers have shown that specialized particles can oscillate together, demonstrating a phenomenon known as emergent behavior. Taking advantage of a phenomenon known as emergent behavior in the microscale, MIT engineers have designed simple microparticles that can collectively generate complex behavior, much the same way that a colony of ants can dig tunnels or collect food. Working together, the microparticles can generate a beating clock that oscillates at a very low frequency. These oscillations can then be harnessed to power tiny robotic devices, the researchers showed. ""In addition to being interesting from a physics point of view, this behavior can also be translated into an on-board oscillatory electrical signal, which can be very powerful in microrobotic autonomy. There are a lot of electrical components that require such an oscillatory input,"" says Jingfan Yang, a recent MIT PhD recipient and one of the lead authors of the new study.",2022-10-16T09:00:00Z

Tiny particles work together to do big things,https://robohub.org/tiny-particles-work-together-to-do-big-things/,"MIT chemical engineers have shown that specialized particles can oscillate together, demonstrating a phenomenon known as emergent behavior. Taking advantage of a phenomenon known as emergent behavior in the microscale, MIT engineers have designed simple microparticles that can collectively generate complex behavior, much the same way that a colony of ants can dig tunnels or collect food. Working together, the microparticles can generate a beating clock that oscillates at a very low frequency. These oscillations can then be harnessed to power tiny robotic devices, the researchers showed. ""In addition to being interesting from a physics point of view, this behavior can also be translated into an on-board oscillatory electrical signal, which can be very powerful in microrobotic autonomy. There are a lot of electrical components that require such an oscillatory input,"" says Jingfan Yang, a recent MIT PhD recipient and one of the lead authors of the new study.",2022-10-16T09:00:00Z

All services that fall into this bracket are powered by artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), and promise the ability to do away with laborious and time-consuming manual transcription, creating fewer bottlenecks in business. The need for accurate automated transcription in both the business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) worlds – as well as occupations like journalism – has been ever present, but this need isn't being served as well as it can be.

""By claiming that racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination can be stripped away from the hiring process using artificial intelligence, these companies reduce race and gender down to insignificant data points, rather than systems of power that shape how we move through the world,"" co-author Dr. Eleanor Drage said in a statement. The researchers noted many businesses now analyze candidate videos using AI, evaluating applicants for the ""big five"" personality traits: extroversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.",2022-10-15T23:50:10Z

These articles are a large-scale knowledge source and can have a huge impact on disseminating knowledge about the mechanisms of certain biological processes. A knowledge graph (KG) can be constructed by integrating such facts and data and be used for data integration, exploration, and federated queries. However, exploration and querying large-scale KGs is tedious for certain groups of users due to a lack of knowledge about underlying data assets or semantic technologies. A question-answering (QA) system allows the answer of natural language questions over KGs automatically using triples contained in a KG.",2022-10-15T15:49:12Z
