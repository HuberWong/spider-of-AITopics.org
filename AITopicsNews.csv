Challenges and opportunities in quantum machine learning - Nature Computational Science,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00311-3,"At the intersection of machine learning and quantum computing, quantum machine learning has the potential of accelerating data analysis, especially for quantum data, with applications for quantum materials, biochemistry and high-energy physics. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding the trainability of quantum machine learning models. Here we review current methods and applications for quantum machine learning. We highlight differences between quantum and classical machine learning, with a focus on quantum neural networks and quantum deep learning. Finally, we discuss opportunities for quantum advantage with quantum machine learning. Quantum machine learning has become an essential tool to process and analyze the increased amount of quantum data. Despite recent progress, there are still many challenges to be addressed and myriad future avenues of research.",2022-10-16T13:40:38Z
DeepMind breaks 50-year math record using AI; new record falls a week later,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/deepmind-breaks-50-year-math-record-using-ai-new-record-falls-a-week-later/,"Matrix multiplication is at the heart of many machine learning breakthroughs, and it just got faster--twice. Last week, DeepMind announced it discovered a more efficient way to perform matrix multiplication, conquering a 50-year-old record. This week, two Austrian researchers at Johannes Kepler University Linz claim they have bested that new record by one step. Matrix multiplication, which involves multiplying two rectangular arrays of numbers, is often found at the heart of speech recognition, image recognition, smartphone image processing, compression, and generating computer graphics. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are particularly good at performing matrix multiplication due to their massively parallel nature.",2022-10-16T13:40:32Z
